# Fam

## Manifesto
The goal with [Fam](https://openfam.com) is to build an **open** community for mobile gamers. Communities are built by a game's most passionate players, not some company, so my goal is to help developers get more people using their tools, and work toward whatever their goals may be (users, income, etc...).

As an open community, Fam is open source. [fam](https://github.com/famhq/fam) contains the client-side code, [radioactive](https://github.com/famhq/radioactive) has the backend code, [fam-assets](https://github.com/famhq/fam-assets) has image assets and [fam-sdk](https://github.com/famhq/fam-sdk) has the SDK.

### Backstory
Fam is an offshoot from a company I started 5 years ago, Clay.io. It was an HTML5 game platform which I raised half a million dollars for and moved out to Silicon Valley to try to grow it. While I loved the bay area, I got really sick of the Silicon Valley culture. There was far too much greed, hype, and arrogance.

Now I'm back in Austin, TX and set out to build something in a much different way from the typical Silicon Valley company. I want to help create something that's open, transparent and ego-less.

### Transparent, but still a business
With that said, I want to be clear upfront that 'open and transparent' doesn't mean we can go on without a business model. To grow this into something meaningful, this still needs to be treated as a business. Money is incredibly important for both the company's long-term growth, and for people who develop apps for the developer platform. The difference is, the business model will be transparent - no selling user data, etc...

### The team
Fam is just me, [Austin](https://github.com/austinhallock), right now.

### Contributing
The easiest thing you can do to help is build something cool for one of the games Fam supports and put it up on the developer platform. As for other contributions to the frontend and backend code for Fam, send me an email (austin@clay.io) if you need help getting everything setup (the documentation is severely lacking at this point).

### Developer platform
There is a [developer platform](https://openfam.com/tools) where you can build your own tools on top of Fam's game data and userbase (millions of users) and keep 100% of your revenue. There isn't any sort of lock-in, you can develop your own website or app outside of Fam, etc... Adding to Fam just gets you extra users and hopefully an easier experience developing the tool.
